The program "ProcessPhoton" allows you to add or change layers to improve the detail of printing with the Anycubic Photon printer. 
The effect is achieved by alternating layers with coarse edges and clear, which reduces the effect of over-illumination.
This software optimized for multi-core CPUs. Scripting engine used for flexible processing layers in future.

Build requires libraries from my alpet-libs repository.

Photon file import/export code was ported from project https://github.com/Photonsters/PhotonFileEditor
